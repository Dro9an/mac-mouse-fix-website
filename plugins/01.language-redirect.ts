/*

    When the user opens a path without a language-prefix, we redirect to the same path, but with a language-prefix.

    Design considerations: [Mar 2025]
    - Ideally we want the redirect to happen before anything else about the page can load â€“ to make things as responsive as possible. 
        We're optimizing for this:
        - The more 'proper' way to do redirects like this is with middleware. However, plugins run earlier in the Nuxt lifecycle.
        - The filename has a `01.` prefix so it's alphabetically ordered before the other plugins. This should make it execute before the other plugins.
    - This is part of our replacement for nuxt-i18n's routing. Based on my minimal testing, nuxt-i18n's routing seems about as fast as this. So I assume there's no easy way to make it faster.

    Observation:
    - [Apr 2025] (In dev builds) linking to a hash url like macmousefix.com/#price is quite janky with a language redirect, since the page will fully load and go to the #price section before *and* after the redirect.
        However, this is not noticable in prod builds.
