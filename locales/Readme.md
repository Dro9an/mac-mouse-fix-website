# Locales Readme

## On automatic analysis

The python script in the MMF repo which automatically analyzes missing, superfluous and outdated translations, relies on the file structure here to be like:

Base file at:
`locales/en-US.js`

Translations at:
`locales/*.js`

(Don't use `.ts` as file extension)\
See the output of the script in the comment at: https://github.com/noah-nuebling/mac-mouse-fix/discussions/731
