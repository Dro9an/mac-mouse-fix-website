If your mouse has fewer than 5 buttons, Mac Mouse Fix still provides rich functionality and a great experience, but some features will be less easy to access compared to a 5-button mouse. On certain mice designed to be used with proprietary driver software like Logitech Options, Mac Mouse Fix can't recognize all the buttons at the moment. Mac Mouse Fix does not currently support the Apple Magic Mouse.",

  /* Scrolling */

    Title Ideas:
    - Scrolling Has Never Felt So Good
    - Scroll About with Style
    - Get On The Scroller-Coaster
    - Bad UX? Scroll Past That.
    - Schlechte Software? Einfach weiterscrollen.
    - Bad software? Just keep scrolling.
    - An Expensive Trackpad? Just Keep Scrolling.
    - Scrolls Like Butter.
    - Scrolling. Smooth Like Butter.
    - Scrolling: Smooth Like Butter.
    - Scrolling. Like Butter.
      - ^ Can't really translate Smooth Like Butter to other languages, but Like Butter might work better? Edit: Nope: Still relies on cultural association between butter and smoothness.

    Body ideas:
    - Mac Mouse Fix makes scrolling feel as **smooth** and **fluid** as on an Apple trackpad, or as **consistent** and **precise** as on Windows - with just a few simple clicks.
      - ^ It's a bit weird to emphasize the way you set things up ("few simple click") right in the intro. Because we should focus on WHAT it does, not how the settings work at first. Also the 'settings are easy' point could be made anywhere. But can't think of a better way to phrase this right now. 
    - Scrolling with a third-party mouse on macOS can feel **jolty** and **hard to control**. With Mac Mouse Fix, scrolling will feel **polished** and **ergonomic**.
      - ^ Don't explain a problem to people they might not have / have never thought about as a problem. Might create disconnect.
    - Mac Mouse Fix makes scrolling on your mouse feel as **smooth** and **fluid** as on an Apple trackpad, or as **consistent** and **precise** as on Windows - Choose your preference with just a few clicks.
      - ^ Leaning MORE into setup, makes it less weird I think.

  /* Action Table */

  /*

  Discussion:
  - We tried to add a numbered list into the action table body, describing the steps to setup a new gesture. Buttt we couldn't get it to work in a reasonable time. So we're just making it as good as possible in a flowing text. Edit: made a numbered list after all.
  - Problem: It might be nicer to have a shorter text, like the MMF 2 reddit post, and then have the details in the video demo. This would sound better and be easier to read. But I think the little MMF-on-studio-display image is hard to make sense of if you don't have the step-by-step instructions. So we're keeping the step-by-step for now.
  - Thought process: We spent a long time on the Section title and body. A LOT of tinkering with the text and then noticing the fundamental idea was flawed. Now our plan is this:
    - The **main goals** we identified for the other section body texts is to:
      - Create context and understanding. Answer the questions: 
        - How does this feature relate to my wants and needs or the wants and needs of other people? 
        - Why does this feature exist in the way it does? What are the thoughts and ideas behind it and its design? 
        - Provide this context and understanding very briefly and at a high level, without going into specifics, because we'll explain specifics later.
      - Furthermore we want to the text to be easy to read, enthusiastic, and have some emotionally resonant, engaging quality to it. Possibly 'narrative' elements to create emotional resonance.
      - We also want to convey a sense of simplicity and high quality of Mac Mouse Fix.
    - Based on these goals we want to say sth like: 'MMF lets you do almost anything you can think of with your mouse. And is remarkably easy to use.'
      - Its very brief compared to the other body texts, but that's okay. It fulfills all the goals we have for the text. It's exciting, desirable, emotionally resonant and engaging/inspiring, and communicates the main idea behind the design and how I feel when I use the UI. 
    - We also had this idea of creating this narrative contrast like the other body texts, where we first present a problem and then say 'not with mac mouse fix'. And the problem we meant to talk about was that other software that is very powerful is usually complicated. But we decided that we shouldn't give this idea high priority in the text because it doesn't help us with the goals listed above. It doesn't relate to any want or need of the user and it doesn't create insight or understanding for the feature and its design. What it's adding is basically just a 'flex'. Saying 'look how impressive and MMF is compared to other software' or saying 'isn't it cool how it breaks the expectaion and is both powerful AND intuitive?'. This is a neat thing to highlight to give the user a sense of quality or 'this is cool', but it's not the main thing we want to focus on. So we want to deemphasize this by putting it at the end, and giving it less text or even removing it completely
    - Since we want to de-emphasize the notion of 'powerful AND simple', we think that we might want to change the title, too, since it's heavily focused around that. But I'm not sure, yet "Amazingly Flexible\n*and* Intuitive." is still acceptable and makes sense I think.
  
    - !!! Update on ^^^: We wrote the section pretty quickly, this approach really works!! I created a mindmap with the 'goals' described above, and then fleshed it out with concrete ideas that fulfill those goals. Finally we put it into a coherent text and polished it by translating back and forth between German and English and and editing together with ChatGPT. And we arrived at a really great result that I'm super happy with in a reasonable amount of time without endless fiddling and revisions. Awesome!

  MMF 2 Reddit Post alternative:
    Move the pointer into the "+" field, then simply show Mac Mouse Fix the clicks and drags that you want to assign a new Action to.

  Alternative action table body:  
    
      **With the Action Table you can add a new action to your mouse in just a few seconds**
      1. Put the mouse pointer over the '+'-field
      2. Click, drag, or scroll on your mouse
      3. Choose an action
      Done! Now you can use the action you chose by clicking, dragging, or scrolling in the way you just did.
      You can also double click, use keyboard modifiers, and more.
