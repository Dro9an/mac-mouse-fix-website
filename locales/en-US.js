    Title Ideas:
    - Scrolling Has Never Felt So Good
    - Scroll About with Style
    - Get On The Scroller-Coaster
    - Bad UX? Scroll Past That.
    - Schlechte Software? Einfach weiterscrollen.
    - Bad software? Just keep scrolling.
    - An Expensive Trackpad? Just Keep Scrolling.
    - Scrolls Like Butter.
    - Scrolling. Smooth Like Butter.
    - Scrolling: Smooth Like Butter.
    - Scrolling. Like Butter.
      - ^ Can't really translate Smooth Like Butter to other languages, but Like Butter might work better? Edit: Nope: Still relies on cultural association between butter and smoothness.

    Body ideas:
    - Mac Mouse Fix makes scrolling feel as **smooth** and **fluid** as on an Apple trackpad, or as **consistent** and **precise** as on Windows - with just a few simple clicks.
      - ^ It's a bit weird to emphasize the way you set things up ("few simple click") right in the intro. Because we should focus on WHAT it does, not how the settings work at first. Also the 'settings are easy' point could be made anywhere. But can't think of a better way to phrase this right now. 
    - Scrolling with a third-party mouse on macOS can feel **jolty** and **hard to control**. With Mac Mouse Fix, scrolling will feel **polished** and **ergonomic**.
      - ^ Don't explain a problem to people they might not have / have never thought about as a problem. Might create disconnect.
    - Mac Mouse Fix makes scrolling on your mouse feel as **smooth** and **fluid** as on an Apple trackpad, or as **consistent** and **precise** as on Windows - Choose your preference with just a few clicks.
      - ^ Leaning MORE into setup, makes it less weird I think.
