  /* Scrolling */

    Title Ideas:
    - Scrolling Has Never Felt So Good
    - Scroll About with Style
    - Get On The Scroller-Coaster
    - Bad UX? Scroll Past That.
    - Schlechte Software? Einfach weiterscrollen.
    - Bad software? Just keep scrolling.
    - An Expensive Trackpad? Just Keep Scrolling.
    - Scrolls Like Butter.
    - Scrolling. Smooth Like Butter.
    - Scrolling: Smooth Like Butter.
    - Scrolling. Like Butter.
      - ^ Can't really translate Smooth Like Butter to other languages, but Like Butter might work better? Edit: Nope: Still relies on cultural association between butter and smoothness.

    Body ideas:
    - Mac Mouse Fix makes scrolling feel as **smooth** and **fluid** as on an Apple trackpad, or as **consistent** and **precise** as on Windows - with just a few simple clicks.
      - ^ It's a bit weird to emphasize the way you set things up ("few simple click") right in the intro. Because we should focus on WHAT it does, not how the settings work at first. Also the 'settings are easy' point could be made anywhere. But can't think of a better way to phrase this right now. 
    - Scrolling with a third-party mouse on macOS can feel **jolty** and **hard to control**. With Mac Mouse Fix, scrolling will feel **polished** and **ergonomic**.
      - ^ Don't explain a problem to people they might not have / have never thought about as a problem. Might create disconnect.
    - Mac Mouse Fix makes scrolling on your mouse feel as **smooth** and **fluid** as on an Apple trackpad, or as **consistent** and **precise** as on Windows - Choose your preference with just a few clicks.
      - ^ Leaning MORE into setup, makes it less weird I think.

  /* Action Table */

  /*

  Discussion:
  - We tried to add a numbered list into the action table body, describing the steps to setup a new gesture. Buttt we couldn't get it to work in a reasonable time. So we're just making it as good as possible in a flowing text.

  Alternative action table body:  
    
      **With the Action Table you can add a new action to your mouse in just a few seconds**
      1. Put the mouse pointer over the '+'-field
      2. Click, drag, or scroll on your mouse
      3. Choose an action
      Done! Now you can use the action you chose by clicking, dragging, or scrolling in the way you just did.
      You can also double click, use keyboard modifiers, and more.

Every detail has been considered to give you the best possible experience while feeling like a natural, lightweight extension of your Mac. Additionally, it is completely open source which means that you can trust that it is secure ((and does not steal your data or mine bitcoin in the background or anything like that)), and (I'm glad to say that) to say the app has been downloaded x times, and users really love it. Here are some positive things that people have to say about the app. Thanks to everyone sharing their feedback...
  content: <Cards of what people said>

  title:
  - Serious bang for your buck
  - Great pricing
  - Free for 30 days, $1.99 to own
  - One simple price
  - One Simple App. One Simple Price.
  content: 
  - Mac Mouse Fix is free for 30 days and costs $1.99 to own. There are no subscriptions or additional costs, and you can easily pay in few clicks from inside the app with Apple Pay, PayPal, Credit card and more.
  - More info (??) on trial: Free days only count down when you actually use the app - so you can relax when testing app without worry that your free days will run out. 
  - More info (??) on comparison to alternatives: Buying Mac Mouse Fix and using it with a cheaper mouse is wayyy cheaper compared to alternatives like buying an MX Master ($99.99 MSRP), or an Apple Trackpad ($129.00 MSRP) - and it's not only cheaper, but - in my opinion - you even get a far nicer experience compared to an MX Master, and even slightly nicer than an Apple Trackpad.
  - More info/rant on why MX Master sucks: The MX Master and other Logitech mice actually has very bad build quality and components compared to its price, and has very bad ergonomics too, at least for my hands. The button placing is very inconvenient, the mouse is way too heavy making it uncomfortable compared to ligher mouse, it's too big, not fitting my hand well, sensor is low quality and inaccurate, lots of input lag on bluetooth, the hardware features it has (gesture button, horizontal wheel, and free-spin) are not well-engineered, and do not feel good or ergonomic to use and their functionality can easily be replaced by Mac Mouse Fix in a better way.
  - Why it's good to pay (???): 
    - Support me. Idk I struggle a lot with life, autism, childhood trauma, can't work a normal job. So I hope I can contribute to society and survive with this. Sincere thanks to anyone paying for the app.
    - Support open source, indie development making software with passion and a focus on a great user experience.
