Old, unused localization files.

- [Mar 2025] de.js contains some quote translations of quotes we've since hidden because haven't gotten express permission for sharing them
- [Mar 2025] Localizable.xcstrings is mostly up-to-date. We removed it because we introduced a separate .xcstrings file for different source-code files, instaed of having everything in one Localizable.xcstrings file.
