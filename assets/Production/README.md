- The video production files files (Davinci Resolve) are in my mega.nz drive (noah.n.developer@gmail.com account). That's because they are really big, and the screen recordings might contain sensitive information.
- We tried to use Git LFS (large file storage) to be able to host these larger video files on github, but the files were going over the free LFS quota from GitHub (only 1gb). Everything still seemed to work fine even though we went over the quota, so I was tempted to just ignore it, but I don't wanna risk things. 
- ^^^ We used to store the video stuff in in the repo mac-mouse-fix-asset-production, which we've since deleted, because we moved everything to either mega or to the website repo.
