# Notes

Project is based on [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovJfnoqUBk8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9haQlqdCQyYmL_27TesCGPC&index=3)
- We diverged from the tutorial at episode #12 - Server Routes, because we want to use SSG and deploy on gh pages instead of using SSR

- Type vbase and choose auto completion for **snippets** from Vue VSCode Snippets plugin
